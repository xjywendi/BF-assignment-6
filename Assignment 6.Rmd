 #Best model: ARIMA(0,1,0)
 #ï¼ˆ0,1,0) model which brings that there is no autogressive and no moving average in this models, and with 1, that means we only took 1 step to get the timeseries to stationary
 #The variance of the residuals(sigma^2) is 119.6 which is not closer to 0, thus this is not such a good fit model for this timeseries.
